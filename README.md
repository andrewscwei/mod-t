# New Matter MOD-t Manual Setup

This is a documentation of manually setting up the New Matter MOD-t after the company has closed down, thus making the New Matter store inaccessible.

## Setup

1. Install MOD-t Printer Tool app. The latest working version is `v1.5.5`.

2. Open MOD-t Printer Tool app and connect the printer via USB to your computer. Update the firmware to the latest. This will disable Wi-Fi on the printer, but this is the only way to get it working unfortunately.

3. Once complete, the status of the printer should now be idle. You can now perform clear nozzle procedure using the include `clearnozzle.gcode` file.
